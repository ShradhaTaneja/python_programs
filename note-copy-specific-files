1. create directory structure in dest folder
2. copy files from source to dest
3. traverse thru dest and remove corresponding files from source. (our source folder will be populated during the time we are running this script.)

3rd step will ensure that we are deleting only those files from source which are copied in the dest folder. 
If we don't do this.. there is a chance of loosing data(since beam will be dumping data many times while running our script). hence no gaurantee, REMEMBER : ANYTHING WHICH IS NOT GAURANTEED IS USELESS.
